As the title suggests, I'm **not** proposing that you stop designing prematurely. On the contrary, anyone who's worked on a project that has lasted more than a couple months knows that you never *really* stop designing. Stakeholders change requirements, developers hit insurmountable roadblocks that threaten target release dates, or heaven forbid, you as a designer, want to tweak the design of a component. Sometimes these speed-bumps come months into a project.

## Is it ever too early?
In my experience, yes.

I know it can be tempting for those of you with a black-belt in SASS and HTML to not immediately reach for those tools and start building something that actually resembles a functioning website. The problem is that you will inevitably limit yourself. I've fallen into this trap more than my fair share. When Bootstrap first came on the scene I thought it was great (I still do)! I immediately had a grid to start playing around with, I had base styles covering everything from line-height to buttons. It was liberating! But what I slowly came to realize was that, although I customized the heck of it, I was still **starting** with defaults and basic assumptions. Defaults and assumptions that should aEven the use of a 12 column grid was an assumption that was made too soon.

I hear hear you. You say "I'm not using BootStrap / Foundation / Bulma, I start from scratch" or "I have my own boilerplate". In the case of the former, you definitely are not designing as fast as you could in a design tool, and in the case of the latter, you are still starting with defaults.

And yes, you could always reach for defaults in a design tool. My point is that it's nowhere near as tempting.

## Okay, so when is the right time?
The short answer? As soon as your design tool starts to get in the way.

If you find yourself adjusting line-height throughout pages of comps or constantly changing field labels, unleashing the power of CSS could really save you some headaches.

I find that one of the great things about Atomic Design is that you can move rapidly from design to development and back again. For example if you are working on a shopping cart 


What is the ideal workflow?
designing 

what about changes?

What if it's not (totally) up to me?
